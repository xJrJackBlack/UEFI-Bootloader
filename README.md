A UEFI Bootloader made for Linux



# Tools and Resources

I was going to initially use GNU-EFI and GCC for this project however i decided to use the following tools for more flexability:

- [UEFI Specification](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_10_Aug29.pdf)
- Clang
- LLVM Linker
- Qemu
- OVMF
